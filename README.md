# Simple Dashboard showing Lessons Available

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I've also use Material UI library which works pretty well with React.js. I have used Axios to send asynchronous HTTP request to endpoints.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
 
### `yarn install`

That will install all dependencies for the project.

### `yarn start`

To run the app.
It should run automatically, alternatively you can open using this url from any broswer: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


### `yarn test`

this is to run some tests. 



## How to use it

Once the app is ready, it should take few **ms** to render. By default it will only display **key-stage-4** lessons. In order to view others availabable lessons, you will need to click inside the **textbox** inside the **AppBar** then choose from the dropdown. By default you can only see 8 lessons cards per page, at the bottom of the page there is a pagination feature that will help you to navigate from one page to another. 
Each lesson card have at the top left corner duration of the lesson, then the title of the lesson, with a bit of description, then two buttons(currently disabled)

## Enjoy it :-)
